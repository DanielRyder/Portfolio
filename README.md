## Dissertation Project: Virtual 3D Weapon Assembly and Usage in VR (2019/20)
This project was completed using Unity and C# for the final year project component of my degree from the University of Sheffield under supervision from Dr Steve Maddock.

Using a VR headset and controllers the player is tasked with assembling weapons from their constituent parts.  Once completed they can use the weapon against a set of targets or enemies.

This project involved the use of 3D math for calculating assembly connections between parts, recursive graph searching algorithms to monitor sub-assemblies, object searching using raycasts and innovative designs for user interfaces in VR.

## Sheff Jam 7 Winning Game: Asymmetrical Multiplayer City Builder/Dodging Runner (2020)
I was part of the team that produced the winning game for Sheff Jam 7, an annual 48 hour game jam competition open to University of Sheffield students.

The game uses a node.js server, javascript and html to allow for two players to play online with each other playing seperate roles with different mechanics but still affecting the same game.

I was responsible for the initial game design, creating all of the music and the artwork, parts of the backend server work and the city building (human) game.

The world is procedurally generated for each game over a 2D grid which is projected differently for the different player roles.

The human can either try to build a clean world, or use up the Earths natural resources and get enough money to escape to Mars.

The sun tries to either help the play build a clean world, or destroy the structures destroying the planet.  Their task becomes increasingly difficult as more objects such as CO2 molecules and planes get in their way.

## Unreal Engine 4 Simple Runner Game (2020)
This is a game I created in UE4 using C++ and blueprints.  The purpose of this project, and other small projects I have completed using UE4 and C++, is to learn rather that to develop a complete game.

## Internet of Things 3rd Year Module: Wireless Robot (2019)
This project used C++ and an ESP32 to remotely control a robot using a browser application that was connected to to a hotspot that the ESP32 was hosting.

## Engineering You're Hired Winning Project: Sea Plough (2019)
Engineering You’re Hired is a week long full time project in which you and a group of engineers all from different disciplines work together to come up with a solution to an engineering problem.  

When tasked with reducing plastic pollution we proposed a sea plough to be deployed in the great pacific garbage patch.  

After winning the professionalism and best proposal award on the Wednesday for our initial presentation I worked on a 3D interactable demo of what a sea plough might look like using the Unity game engine and C#.

The boat responds to the waves using vertex normals to calculate forces to be applied, and the boat can be driven from a 3rd person and 1st person view.

After showing this demo and presenting the solution to an industry expert we won the award for the best solution.

## A-Level Project: Local Multiplayer 2D Archery Game (2015/16)
This game was made as part of my A-level in computing using Unity and C#.  With controller support it lets up to four players move and jump around a level trying to shoot each other with arrows.  

It is a physics based game and also has a quiz component that lets the player gain powerups by answering questions correctly.

## 3D Graphics Module: OpenGL Snowman (2019)
In this module I was tasked with creating a 3D snowman from scratch using OpenGL.  There is a user interface which can control the animations and lighting.
